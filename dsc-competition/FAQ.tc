_cat_cccodec.so is not copiled in 64 bit. need the makefile for thie share object library

Q: I got an error where some .so files cannot be found is a certain path?
A: 
1. Do 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib' in the command line. 
2. If 1. doesn't work, check the specific path (usually /usr/local/lib/) and see whether you have the .so file
